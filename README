Doctor On Call Simulator

    Doctor On Call Simulator is a Pygame-based simulation game where you treat patients with diverse conditions and personalities, make quick and accurate decisions, and manage your time wisely. Your goal is to provide the best care possible, maintain a strong clinic rating, and prove that your clinic deserves to stay open after the critical first three days!



Gameplay

    Treat 5 patients per day.

    Each patient has:
    A medical condition.
    A personality, which determines how quickly they need care.
    Choose the correct medication and decide whether to admit the patient or finish care.
    Complete 3 days with an average rating of 3 stars or higher to prove your clinic deserves to stay open.

Controls

    Mouse Clicks to:
    Select a medication from the right-hand blue box.
    Click Admit to Specialist or Finish Care buttons.
    Quit the game using the close window button.

Scoring & Rating

    Proper treatment gives 4–5 stars.
    Improper treatment gives 1–3 stars.
    Timeouts result in 1 star.

    At the end of each day, you can see the average rating and individual patient ratings.
    If your clinic drops below 3 stars by the end of day 3, it will close permanently.
